# Blog App

A simple blog application built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Prisma. This app allows users to list posts from an API and filter posts by the userId of whoever wrote the post.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

Second, create the database:

```bash
npm run db:push
# or
yarn db:push
# or
pnpm db:push
```

Then, seed the database:

```bash
npm run db:seed
# or
yarn db:seed
# or
pnpm db:seed
```

Then, run the project:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
